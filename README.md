# CTF Toolkit

A comprehensive web-based toolkit designed for Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. This toolkit provides a variety of essential tools commonly used in CTF challenges, including cryptography utilities, encoding/decoding tools, web exploitation helpers, and miscellaneous utilities.

## Features

### Cryptography Tools
- Hash generators (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512)
- Caesar cipher encoder/decoder
- ROT13 encoder/decoder
- Vigenère cipher encoder/decoder

### Encoding/Decoding Tools
- Base64 encoder/decoder
- URL encoder/decoder
- Hex to ASCII and ASCII to Hex converter
- Binary to Text and Text to Binary converter
- HTML entity encoder/decoder

### Web Tools
